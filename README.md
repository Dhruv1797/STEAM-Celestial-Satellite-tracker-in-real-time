# Steam Celestial Satellite tracker in real time

__Welcome to the STEAM Celestial Satellite project__

This project represents the orbit of a satellite orbiting earth on an
Arduino-controlled pointer and a Liquid Galaxy rig through a mobile application. This project was developed within the Google Summer of Code 2023 program.


 ### Main technologies and languages used

* Arduino UNO
* HC-05 Bluetooth module
* C ++
* Dart

### Getting started

Before continuing, make sure to have installed in your machine [Git](https://git-scm.com/) , [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

Then, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/STEAM-Celestial-Satellite-tracker-in-real-time.git
$ cd STEAM-Celestial-Satellite-tracker-in-real-time
```

With the project cloned, run it by using the following command:

> ‚ùó You must have a mobile device connected or an android emulator running in order to run the app.

```bash
$ flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```
